## Introduction to C++ STL

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes with templates and function templates with operators as arguments. It includes several containers (such as vectors, lists, and maps), algorithms (sorting, searching, and more), and iterators for these containers, making it a fundamental part of C++ programming. STL simplifies complex data structure implementations and enables efficient, reusable code.

## Getting Started
